  title: What's wrong with CurseForge?
  color: orange
---

CurseForge added a new option to block third party clients like Prism Launcher from accessing mod files, and they started to enforce this option lately. We can't allow you to download those mods directly from Curseforge because of this. However, Prism Launcher offers a workaround to enable the downloading of these mods, by allowing you to download these mods from your browser and automatically importing them into the instance. We highly encourage asking authors that opted out of client downloads to stop doing so.
