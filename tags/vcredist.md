Like most apps on Windows, you have to install vcredist for Prism to run.

You need:

- [vcredist 2022 x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if you're using PrismLauncher-Windows-MSVC (the reccomended version for Windows 10 64 bit/Windows 11)
- [vcredist 2022 x86](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) if you're using PrismLauncher-Windows-MSVC-Legacy (the reccomended version for Windows 7/8.1 and Windows 10 32 bit)
- [vcredist 2022 arm64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.arm64.exe) if you're using PrismLauncher-Windows-MSVC-arm64 (the reccomended version for Windows 10/11 on ARM)
