This is useful for finding a broken mod among hundreds of mods, without having to spend time testing the mods one-by-one.\nThe procedure is simple:\n1. Remove half of the existing things, and put them aside.\n2. Run the program / game.\n3. Does the issue still exist?\nIf YES: Repeat from step 1 with the current things.\nIF NO: Swap out the current things with the ones set aside, and repeat from step 1.\n4. Repeat this process until the problematic thing/s have been found.\n\n      Credit to the Quilt Community discord and the Forge Discord for these instructions."

If one of your mods is weird and requires newer java, you can bypass this going to instance settings-Java and ticking 'Skip java compatibility checks', but be aware of potential issues, such as [random CMEs](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149777).",

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\nMany computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\nThere really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machineâ€™s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!"
